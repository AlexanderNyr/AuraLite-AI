# 🔧 Changelog — AuraLite AI v2.4.1 (2026-06-20)

## PyInstaller / Windows frozen build fix
- Fixed a crash where `model_engine/__init__.py` dynamically loaded `../model_engine.py`, which is not bundled by PyInstaller in `dist/.../_internal/`.
- Added bundled `model_engine/_legacy.py` and changed the shim to import it normally so PyInstaller discovers it.
- Updated `build_exe.bat` with explicit `--collect-submodules` / `--hidden-import` flags.
- Removed duplicate `model_engine` from `pyproject.toml` `py-modules` because the package now owns that import name.

# 🚀 Changelog — AuraLite AI v2.4 (2026-06-20)

## Production-Grade Core
- Added `model_engine/` package layout with compatibility shim for legacy `model_engine.py` imports.
- Added typed `AuraLiteConfig`, backend abstractions, `PagedDataset`, profiler utilities, optional kernels, and OpenAI-compatible FastAPI server.

## Model Architecture
- Reworked RoPE to the LLaMA/Hugging Face `rotate_half` formula with exact inverse frequencies.
- Added improved Linear / Dynamic-NTK / YaRN scaling.
- Hardened GQA KV-cache: stores unrepeated KV heads, supports sliding-window eviction, optional low-precision cache storage.
- Added explicit `tie_weights()` / `untie_weights()` and optional untied embedding mode.
- Added optional Top-2 MoE, sliding-window attention, FlexAttention flag with SDPA fallback, and speculative decoding API fallback.

## Quantization
- Added HQQ and FP8 enum support.
- Improved GPTQ Hessian handling with Cholesky inversion fallback.
- Added AWQ alpha + clip-ratio grid search.

## RAG / Serving / DevOps
- Added persistent optional vector store, semantic chunking, HyDE query expansion, and citation context.
- Added Docker multi-stage CPU/CUDA runtime, CI workflow, pre-commit, pyproject optional dependency groups.
